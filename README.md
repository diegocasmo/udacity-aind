# [Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889)
A repository of multiple projects and labs done in the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree (aind).

### [Sudoku](/sudoku)

In this project, you will be writing code to implement two extensions of our sudoku solver. The first one will be to implement the technique called "naked twins". The second one will be to modify our existing code to solve a diagonal sudoku. To complete this project you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson, and build upon them.

### [Build A Game-Playing Agent (Isolation)](/isolation)

In this lesson, you'll build a Game-Playing agent that defeats opponents in Isolation. Along the way, you'll learn about advanced Game-Playing techniques such as Minimax, Iterative Deepening, and Alpha-Beta Pruning.

### [Lab: Simulated Annealing](/simulated-annealing)

In this exercise you will check your understanding of simulated annealing by implementing the algorithm in a Jupyter notebook and using it to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between US state capitals.

### [Lab: Constraint Satisfaction Problems](/constraint-satisfaction)

In this exercise you will check your understanding of Constraint Satisfaction Problems by solving the N-queens problem using symbolic constraints and backtracking search in a Jupyter notebook.

### [Planning](/planning)

In this project, you will define a group of problems in classical PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) for the air cargo domain discussed in the lectures. You will then set up the problems for search, experiment with various automatically generated heuristics, including planning graph heuristics, to solve the problems, and then provide an analysis of the results. Additionally, you will write a short research review paper on the historical development of planning techniques and their use in artificial intelligence.
